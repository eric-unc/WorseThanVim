# WorseThanVim
**WorseThanVim** (**WTV**) is an `ed`-inspired text editor which is a C++ port of [BetterThanVim](https://github.com/eric-unc/BetterThanVim).

## Is WorseThanVim really worse than Vim?
No.

## Installion
All of this work was done in a container. Do `./build-image.ps1` or `./build-image.sh` or build the Docker image, and then `./run-container.ps1` or `./run-container.sh`

Given the proper environment, the `Makefile` in `src` is enough to compile a the project. Just do `make`. Then move the `wtv` binary executable to somewhere on the path.

## Running
BetterThanVim's README describes how the project works. This should work the same.

## Authors
Just me (Eric Schneider) again.
